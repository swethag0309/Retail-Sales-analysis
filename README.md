# Retail-Sales-analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive, end-to-end data analysis project demonstrating proficiency across the entire data lifecycle, from initial Data Cleaning and Preprocessing to advanced Customer Segmentation and Business Intelligence reporting.

### Detailed Project Components
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Excel)
  Initial Data Audit: Conducted a preliminary check for consistency, completeness, and validity of the raw dataset.
  Data Transformation: Handled missing values, identified and treated outliers, and standardized data formats (e.g., dates, currency).
  Feature Engineering Prep: Prepared the dataset structure for seamless integration into the database and analytical environment.
  
### 2.Data Storage, Querying, and Transformation (SQL)
  Database Setup: Designed and implemented an appropriate relational schema for optimal storage and retrieval.
  Complex Querying: Used SQL to perform data retrieval, aggregation (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT), and filtering (WHERE, HAVING).
  Data Transformation: Employed advanced SQL techniques like Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK), Joins (Inner, Left, Right), and CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for complex transformations and view creation.
  
### 3.Data Analysis and Visualization (Python)
  The analytical core of the project was built using Python:
  Data Manipulation: Leveraged Pandas for efficient data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and restructuring.
  Numerical Operations: Utilized NumPy for high-performance array operations and statistical calculations.
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies.
  Visualization: Created informative and compelling data visualizations using:
    Matplotlib: For foundational plots (histograms, scatter plots, line charts).
    Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations (heatmaps, pair plots, box plots).
    
### 4.Customer Segmentation (Python)
  RFM Analysis: Implemented Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to group customers based on purchasing behavior.
  Segment Profiling: Detailed the characteristics and value of each identified customer segment.

### 5.Business Intelligence and Reporting (Power BI)
  Interactive Dashboard Creation: Developed a professional, interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and analytical insights.
  Data Modeling: Established robust relationships between data tables within Power BI.
  DAX Measures: Wrote DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create complex calculations and custom metrics (e.g., rolling averages, year-over-year growth).
  Actionable Insights: Translated the data analysis into clear, actionable business recommendations presented through the dashboard.

### 6.End-to-End Data Pipeline IntegrationWorkflow:
  Demonstrated a complete, reproducible workflow starting from raw data input and concluding with a finalized BI report.
  Documentation: Clear steps are provided to replicate the data flow from CSV/Excel > SQL > Python Analysis > Power BI.
